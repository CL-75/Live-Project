# Live-Project
My work on a Live Project where I, along with others, created a web app using Django to store information involving a hobby of our choosing.

My web app keeps a database of video games the user can add, edit, or delete from. Adding a game allows the user to input the game title, genre, publisher, price, and their own rating. The user can also create their own profiles.
